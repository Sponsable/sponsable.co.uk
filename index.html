    <h2> Everything you need to know before joining the Sponsable waitlist</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>What is an affiliate marketing platform and how does Sponsable benefit me?</summary>
      <p>
        An affiliate marketing platform connects creators with brands, allowing you to earn commissions by promoting products.
        Sponsable goes further by tracking your affiliate sales and using your performance and audience engagement to build a
        verified <strong>Sponsorship Score</strong>. This score helps you prove your value to brands and unlock real sponsorship
        opportunities. With Sponsable, you’re not just earning commissions—you’re building a track record that opens doors to
        lasting brand partnerships and grows your creator career.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Is there a subscription to join Sponsable as an affiliate?</summary>
      <p>
        No, Sponsable requires a one-time fee of <strong>£4.99</strong> to join. This fee covers the thorough vetting process that
        every creator must pass before they can start promoting.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Why is there a vetting process?</summary>
      <p>
        The vetting process ensures Sponsable stays a safe and trusted space for both creators and brands. We protect brand
        reputations and maintain quality partnerships by requiring creators to meet high standards.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How do I find programs and offers to promote that fit my values and audience?</summary>
      <p>
        When you onboard, you complete a questionnaire that helps us recommend campaigns tailored to your niche and interests.
        You can also search the marketplace for specific products. For sponsorships, brands typically approach you, and you can
        accept or reject their offers. If you’re particularly interested in certain brands, you can favorite them, signaling your
        enthusiasm and fostering more authentic partnerships.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What are the requirements to join Sponsable?</summary>
      <p>
        Our vetting process evaluates creators across key areas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Audience Authenticity & Engagement:</strong> Using tools to detect fake followers and engagement, we ensure your audience is real and engaged.</li>
        <li><strong>Content & Brand Alignment:</strong> We assess if your content style, tone, and values align with Sponsable’s ethical standards and check for past sponsorship authenticity or reputational risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Community & Peer Validation:</strong> We collect references from brands or peers and monitor ongoing campaign performance and professionalism to ensure sustainable success.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This vetting helps maintain an exclusive, high-quality platform benefiting creators, brands, and audiences alike.

      <h2>Why I'm Building Sponsable</h2>
      <p>
        I was preparing to recreate Shackleton’s crossing in South Georgia, relying on sponsorships to cover costs and build future brand relationships. Despite it being my second polar expedition, I had no proven track record to demonstrate my commercial value to brands.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I was generating affiliate sales, it still felt like a one-sided game—helping brands grow without building genuine partnerships or clearly proving my influence. This challenge is shared by many outdoor creators.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why I’m building Sponsable—to give creators a real way to prove their value, build genuine brand partnerships, and turn affiliate efforts into lasting opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
  Sponsable is currently in development, and we’re vetting early creators and brands ahead of launch. Join now to help shape the future of ethical sponsorships.
