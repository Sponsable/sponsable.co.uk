           <h2> Everything you need to know before joining the Sponsable waitlist</h2>



    <details>

      <summary>What is an affiliate marketing platform and how does Sponsable benefit me?</summary>

      <p>

        An affiliate marketing platform connects creators with brands, allowing you to earn commissions by promoting products.

        Sponsable goes further by tracking your affiliate sales and using your performance and audience engagement to build a <strong>Sponsorship Score</strong>. This score helps you prove your value to brands and unlock real sponsorship

        opportunities. With Sponsable, you’re not just earning commissions—you’re building a track record that opens doors to

        lasting brand partnerships and grows your creator career.

      </p>

    </details>



    <details>

      <summary>Do I pay a subscription to use Sponsable as an affiliate?</summary>

      <p>

        No, Sponsable requires a one-time fee of <strong>£4.99</strong> to join. This fee covers the thorough vetting process that

        every creator must pass before they can start promoting.

      </p>

    </details>



    <details>

      <summary>Why is there a vetting process?</summary>

      <p>

        The vetting process ensures Sponsable stays a safe and trusted space for both creators and brands. We protect brand

        reputations and maintain quality partnerships by requiring creators to meet high standards.

      </p>

    </details>



    <details>

      <summary>How do I find programs and offers to promote that fit my values and audience?</summary>

      <p>

        When you onboard, you complete a questionnaire that helps us recommend campaigns tailored to your niche and interests.

        You can also search the marketplace for specific products. For sponsorships, brands typically approach you, and you can

        accept or reject their offers. If you’re particularly interested in certain brands, you can favorite them, signaling your

        enthusiasm and fostering more authentic partnerships.

      </p>

      <summary>What are the requirements to join Sponsable?</summary>

      <p>

        Our vetting process evaluates creators across key areas:

      </p>

      <ul>

        <li><strong>Audience Authenticity & Engagement:</strong> Using tools to detect fake followers and engagement, we ensure your audience is real and engaged.</li>

        <li><strong>Content & Brand Alignment:</strong> We assess if your content style, tone, and values align with Sponsable’s ethical standards and check for past sponsorship authenticity or reputational risks.</li>

        <li><strong>Community & Peer Validation:</strong> We collect references from previous brand deals and monitor ongoing campaign performance and professionalism to ensure sustainable success.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>

        This vetting helps maintain an exclusive, high-quality platform benefiting creators, brands, and audiences alike.
