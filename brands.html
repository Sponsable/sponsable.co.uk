      <h2>Why Brands Choose Sponsable</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">Here are the precise, practical benefits brands receive when working with Sponsable — reflecting real platform value, not generic influencer features.</p>

      <ul class="benefits-list">

        <li><strong>2.</strong> Run affiliate and sponsorship campaigns with full transparency: sales data, engagement metrics, and compliance insights for every creator.</li>
        <li><strong>3.</strong> Confidently attribute affiliate sales and ROI to specific creators, investing more budget in those who prove their impact.</li>
        <li><strong>4.</strong> Safeguard brand reputation by partnering only with creators verified for ethical content, authentic audiences, and trustworthy conduct.</li>
        <li><strong>5.</strong> Launch eco-friendly or purpose-driven campaigns that attract modern, value-aligned consumers.</li>
        <li><strong>6.</strong> Target niche or underrepresented audiences (climbers, runners, surfers) via Sponsable’s specialized creator segments.</li>
        <li><strong>7.</strong> Review live <strong>Sponsorship Scores</strong> and campaign records before you commit — data-backed partnership choices, every time.</li>
        <li><strong>8.</strong> Leverage real-time feedback and monitoring to optimize spend and scale proven partnerships.</li>
        <li><strong>9.</strong> Build long-term creator relationships that drive genuine advocacy, repeated sales, and measurable engagement — not just reach.</li>
