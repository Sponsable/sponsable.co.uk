            <h1>Building the Future of Responsible Sponsorships</h1>
            <p>
              Sponsable empowers every stakeholder in sponsorship — athletes,
              brands, and agencies — with transparent, data-driven insight
              that rewards performance and integrity.

          <h2>How Sponsable Works</h2>
          <p>
            Athletes and creators join Sponsable to earn through affiliate
            marketing while building a Sponsorship Score that proves their
            value to brands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brands discover and collaborate with vetted creators who align
            with their requirements and deliver measurable results.
          </p>
          <p>
            As creators grow, agencies can scout top performers, manage
            sponsorships, and track performance automatically — saving time
            and improving deal quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether independent or represented, every athlete builds a
            transparent, data-backed record of their commercial impact —
            making Sponsable the trusted pathway to real sponsorships.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Business Model</h2>
          <p>
            We believe in transparency. Our business model is built on
            partnership and aligned with the success of our entire
            community.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Shared Affiliate Commissions:</strong> When a creator
              generates a sale through an affiliate link, we retain a small
              percentage of the total commission paid by the brand. We only
              make money when our creators make money.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Brand & Agency Subscriptions:</strong> We charge
              brands and agencies a recurring (SaaS) subscription fee to
              access our platform, analytics, creator discovery tools, and
              campaign management features.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Brand Deal Service Fees:</strong> When a sponsorship
              deal is secured and processed through our platform, we charge a
              service fee (a "take rate"). This fee is
              significantly lower than a traditional talent agency,
              reflecting our role as a technology platform, not a personal
              agent.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This model allows us to keep the core Sponsable platform free for
            creators.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Symbol, Our Vision</h2>
          <img
            src="logo-bird-type.jpg"
            alt="Sponsable logo with Arctic Tern"
            class="about-image"
          />
          <p>
            Our logo is a tern, and it was chosen for a specific reason. The
            Arctic Tern holds the record for the longest migration on Earth
            (from pole to pole… every year!). The species embodies endurance,
            precision, and drive.
          </p>
          <p>
            We envision a world where every creator, from grassroots athletes
            to global icons, can embark on their own journey and use
            Sponsable as the engine to turn their influence into a
            meaningful career. We believe in a world where every brand can
            sponsor responsibly, with confidence and trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our founder, Ben Rodriguez-Cobham, is an adventurer and athlete
            who experienced the challenges of sponsorship first-hand. His
            background in expeditions and brand partnerships inspired him to
            found Sponsable as a more transparent, data-driven, and
            responsible pathway to sponsorship for all.
          </p>
