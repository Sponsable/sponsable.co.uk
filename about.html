      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        While preparing for an expedition, I struggled to secure sponsorships — not due to lack of effort, but because there was no clear way to prove my commercial value to brands.
      </p>
      <p>
        That revealed a wider problem: thousands of athletes and outdoor creators drive real sales through affiliate marketing but can’t turn that success into lasting partnerships. Meanwhile, brands have no reliable way to find creators who are both effective and brand-safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sponsable solves this by building a <strong>responsible</strong> ecosystem where creators can prove their value and brands can invest with confidence.
